## THE PAST AND FUTURE OF HABITABLE PLANETS AND MOONS

Starting of Planet VENUS
4.6 billion years ago, Tiny planetesimals/rocks combined to from Venus.   4 billion years ago, A giant object hit VENUS forming a moon (similar to how our moon formed). 4 billion years ago (10 million years after first impact), Another Giant object hit Venus, which reversed it's direction of rotation. Venus lost its moon as the spiralled inwards & merged back with the planets.

2.5 billion yeras ago, Venus' early oceans evaporated due to proximity to sun. Carbondioxide dominated the atmosphere causing "Runaway Greenhouse effect leading to high temperatures.
